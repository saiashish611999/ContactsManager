# ContactsManager

ContactsManager is a **basic end-to-end ASP.NET Core MVC application** designed to demonstrate **advanced, production-level concepts** using **ASP.NET Core 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10**.

Although the application functionality is intentionally simple, the **architecture, patterns, and implementation choices** reflect how **real-world enterprise MVC applications** are built.

> ⚠️ Note: The CSS styling is intentionally minimal and somewhat unpolished.
> The primary focus of this project is **architecture, backend design, MVC patterns, and production readiness**, not UI/UX polish.
